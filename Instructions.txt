************************************************************************
Notes:  In Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.

The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn’t let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands.

Common Options

a) git branch
	List all of the branches in your repository. This is synonymous with git branch --list.

b) git branch <branch>
	Create a new branch called <branch>. This does not check out the new branch.

c) git branch -d <branch>
	Delete the specified branch. This is a “safe” operation in that Git prevents you from deleting the branch if it has unmerged changes.

d) git branch -D <branch>
	Force delete the specified branch, even if it has unmerged changes. This is the command to use if you want to permanently throw away all of the commits associated with a particular line of development.

e) git branch -m <branch>
	Rename the current branch to <branch>.

f) git branch -a
	List all remote branches.

6. write branchname as siddaram_ref_notes
	git branch your_name_ref_Notes 

7. Note that this only creates the new branch. To start adding commits to it, you need to select it with git checkout
	git checkout

8. In order to operate on remote branches, a remote repo must first be configured and added to the local repo config.
	git remote add new-remote-repo https://github.com/Shamture/DevInterns.git

9. push your new branch yourName_ref_notes branch to new-remote-repo
	git push DevInterns siddaram_ref_notes

10. You will see the new branch created in remote. you can check it by browsing online repository in github.
